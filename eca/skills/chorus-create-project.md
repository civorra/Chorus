# Skill — chorus-create-project

> Trigger: `chorus-create-project <sandbox-name> <output-file.json>`
> Agent: `architect`
>
> `<sandbox-name>`: sandbox containing a KB produced by `chorus-feed`
> `<output-file.json>`: name of the JSON file to create in `$SANDBOX/`
>
> **Single responsibility: create a valid project JSON file.**
> This skill reads the sandbox KB to infer types, slots, and thresholds,
> then generates a JSON file populated with both conforming AND non-conforming
> elements that explore the variety of the domain.
>
> Prerequisites: `chorus-feed <sandbox-name>` must have been run beforehand.
>
> ⚠️ **Sources to use — strict order:**
> 1. `$SANDBOX/eca/agents/index.org` → Frame types, pipeline, namespace
> 2. `$SANDBOX/eca/agents/<slug>.org` → mandatory slots, thresholds, helpers
> 3. An existing `projet-*.json` file in `$SANDBOX/` → reference format
>
> ⛔ **Never read** `Helpers.pm`, `Feed.pm`, `Agent/*.pm`, `Expert.pm`, `run.pl`
> to create a project. These files are derived from the org KBs — the canonical
> source is always the org KB.

## Phase 0 — Read the KB (single source)

### 0.1 Pipeline index

Read `$SANDBOX/eca/agents/index.org`:
- Perl namespace of the project
- Ordered list of agents (slug, module, pos)
- Global slot dictionary (if present)

### 0.2 KB of each agent

For each agent, read `$SANDBOX/eca/agents/<slug>.org` and extract:

| KB Section | What to extract |
|---|---|
| `Catalogue des Frames` | Element types + mandatory/optional slots per type |
| `Dictionnaire des slots` | Exact slot names, value types, valid domains |
| `Slots de ciblage` | Slot(s) that Feed must set for the agent to see the Frame |
| `Helpers Perl` (KB section) | Normative tables: thresholds, ranges, admitted classes |
| `Contraintes & Pitfalls` | Edge cases to cover in the project |

> **Rule:** threshold tables are in the `Helpers Perl` section of the org KBs —
> they are identical to the code in `Helpers.pm`. Do not open `Helpers.pm`.

### 0.3 Reference format

If a `projet-*.json` file exists in `$SANDBOX/`, read its first 30 lines
to confirm the JSON format (keys `projet`, `description`, `elements`, fields `id`, `type_element`).
Do not read individual elements — types and slots are in the KB.

---

## Phase 1 — Plan the coverage

Build a coverage table before generating any element:

| Type | Conforming cases | Non-conforming cases | Variants |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<type_1>` | N | N | zones, classes, sections... |
| `<type_2>` | N | N | ... |

**Minimum coverage rules:**
- ✅ At least **2 conforming elements** per type (different nominal values)
- ❌ At least **1 non-conforming element** per known rejection rule (§ corpus)
- 🔀 **Dimensional variety**: cover the extreme ranges of continuous slots
  (e.g. min/max values of normative ranges, admitted categories or classes)
- 📐 **Edge cases**: value exactly at the threshold (conforming) and just below (non-conforming)

**Target volume:** adapt to context. For a scaling test → ≥ 100 elements.
For functional validation → 10–30 elements, all types covered.

---

## Phase 2 — Compute values

For each element, compute values **from the KB tables** — never by intuition.

### Sample computations

Adapt the examples to the normative tables read from the sandbox KB.
For each rejection rule, extract the threshold and compute a value that crosses
the threshold in the correct direction.

> ⚠️ **Compute, don't guess.** For each non-conforming case, verify
> that the chosen value actually crosses the threshold in the correct direction.
> Annotate the computation in a `_note_calc` JSON field if useful.

---

## Phase 3 — Generate the JSON

### Mandatory structure

```json
{
  "projet": "<nom-sans-espaces>",
  "description": "<description concise — types, zones, objectif>",
  "elements": [
    {
      "id":           "<TYPE-VARIANTE-NN>",
      "type_element": "<type>",
      "<slot_1>":     <valeur>,
      "<slot_2>":     <valeur>
    }
  ]
}
```

### `id` naming convention

```
<TYPE>-<VARIANTE>-<NN>
```

| Segment | Examples |
|---|---|
| `<TYPE>` | abbreviation of `type_element` (2–4 uppercase letters) |
| `<VARIANTE>` | `OK`, `KO-<CRITERE>`, significant dimensional values |
| `<NN>` | `01`, `02`... |

Generic examples: `EL-OK-01`, `EL-KO-SEC-01`, `EL-H2500-01`

### Slots to include

For each type, include in order:
1. `id` and `type_element` — always first
2. Mandatory slots (extracted from the `Catalogue des Frames` KB)
3. Targeting slot(s) for agent 1 (exact name in the KB: `Slots de ciblage` section)
4. Optional slots relevant to the rules being exercised
5. ⛔ Do not include system slots (`_*`), nor slots set and computed by the agents
   (results, statuses, qualifications) — these slots are computed by the pipeline, not supplied in the project JSON

### Slots set by Feed vs slots provided in the JSON

Some slots are computed/normalized by `Feed.pm` from a source slot;
they must **not** be provided explicitly if Feed computes them.

> **Rule:** if the KB documents a transformation `slot_source → slot_cible`,
> provide the **source** slot in the JSON, not the target slot.
> Identify these transformations from the `Normalisations` section of `index.org`
> — never from the thresholds or the logic of `Feed.pm`.

---

## Phase 4 — Validate the JSON before execution

Before running `perl run.pl`, perform a quick validation:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('<fichier.json>')); print('JSON valide')"
```

Check:
- [ ] JSON syntactically valid (no trailing comma, correct quotes)
- [ ] Each element has `id` and `type_element`
- [ ] All types are present in `%SLOTS_REQUIS` of `Feed.pm`
  (or verify in the `Catalogue des Frames` of the KB — equivalent source)
- [ ] No slot computed by the pipeline (result slots, qualification/evaluation status slots) is provided
- [ ] Non-conforming values actually cross the threshold (recompute if in doubt)
- [ ] ⚠️ **For CONFORMING cases: verify ALL criteria of ALL rules** that apply
  to the type — not just the primary criterion.
  An element may pass the first criterion and fail a secondary criterion of the same rule.
  For each type, list all criteria from the KB and check them one by one.
  Annotate each verified criterion in the `_note_calc` field of the JSON.

---

## Phase 5 — Execute and verify

```bash
perl $SANDBOX/run.pl $SANDBOX/<fichier.json>
```

Check:
- [ ] No Feed crash (unknown type, missing slot)
- [ ] `Non traités : 0` — every element must reach the final conformity status
- [ ] Expected KO elements are indeed `NON_CONFORME` with the correct reason
- [ ] Expected OK elements are indeed `CONFORME`
- [ ] `Pipeline : SOLVED ✅`

If an expected KO element is CONFORME → investigate:
1. Does the CONDITION of the targeted rule exclude this type? ← most common pitfall
2. Does the EXCEPTION short-circuit the rule? (slot already set by a preceding rule)
3. Does the provided value actually cross the threshold? (recompute)

## Separation of responsibilities

| | `chorus-feed` | `chorus-create-project` | `chorus-check` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reads** | normative corpus | sandbox org KB | org KB + YAML |
| **Produces** | org KB, YAML, Helpers.pm | `projet-*.json` file | Feed.pm, Agent shells, Expert.pm, run.pl |
| **Source of thresholds** | corpus | org KB (Helpers Perl section) | org KB |
| **Never reads** | — | Helpers.pm, Feed.pm, *.pm | — |
